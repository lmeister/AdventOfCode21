# AdventOfCode2021
https://adventofcode.com/2021

I am not trying to leaderboard, merely trying to learn new concepts and to improve my overall code quality.

Let's try sticking to it this year. Really :D.

# Contributing & Feedback
Please, if you have any constructive feedback or ideas to improve the code (Be it performance or quality) file a pull request and leave an explanation or contact me in any other way. 
I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.

I am eager to learn and constantly looking to improve.
